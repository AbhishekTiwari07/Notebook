## The problem:

During the pandemic, Education is one of the field that got highly affected
Online classes aren't that much effective.
Students are unable to interact with each other and solve doubts at their level.


## How it solves:

- Gives stage to understudy so they can help one another and make their own study material.
- We can conceptualize our thoughts and offer it with others in single notepad.
- It always easy to rectify the understanding in peer study

## Features:

- Add notes according to there Institute and Course.
- Anybody can alter the notes progressively.
- Anybody can get to the notes at any snap of time.
- Brainstorming and extemporization gets simpler.
- Promotes interactive study between students

## Requirements :

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

### Node
- #### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      $ sudo apt install nodejs
      $ sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems
  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    $ npm install npm -g
